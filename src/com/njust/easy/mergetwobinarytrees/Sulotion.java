 * Created by trey on 17-7-7.
 *  Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other,
 *  some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.You need to merge them
 *  into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as
 *  the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.
